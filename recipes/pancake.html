        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, egg, and melted butter.</li>
            <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix; it's okay if there are  a few lumps.</li>
            <li>Heat a griddle or frying pan over medium heat and lightly grease it with butter or cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Flip the pancakes and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Remove the pancakes from the griddle and keep warm. Serve with your favorite toppings such as syrup, butter, and fresh fruit.</li>
        </ol>
